    <br><br><h3><b>Edit Signed In Shift</b></h3>
	<b>Opens from the Status page > Edit Timesheet Form</b><br><br>
	
	This form opens when a shift has been signed in. 
                  Any changes to this form will only affect the shift being edited, not future shifts as a result of Repeat Weekly. <br><br>
                  
                  The purpose of this form is to change the sign out time or work location after they have signed in. 
                  This way the employee can sign out themselves at the set time with a signature, instead of a supervisor having to signed them out
                  through the Edit Shift Form.
