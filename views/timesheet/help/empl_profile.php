    <br><br><h3><b>Profile</b></h3>
    This form shows contact information for the currently viewed employee. The fields that are not grayed-out can be editted by both the supervisor and the employee. Press the Save button after making changes or the Cancel button to reload the page and reset changes that have not been saved.
	<br>Future improvements to this form include allowing users to enter a profile picture and showing who supervises the viewed employee.
