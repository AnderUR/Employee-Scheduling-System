    <br><br><h3><b>Previous & Next Day Arrows</b></h3>
    These arrows change the employee arrival status being shown to the previous or next day's. 
    
    <br><br><h3><b>Selected Date</b></h3>
    The date between the arrows show the date being viewed. 
    Clicking this input opens a date picker that is used to change the data in the table to reflect the selected date.
    
    <br><br><h3><b>Refresh</b></h3>
    If the status table is currently showing today's data, clicking this button will simply refresh the page to show current data. 
    On the other hand, if the table is showing data for a day other than today, clicking this button will take the user back to today.
    <b>It is recommended to click this button when first accessing the page, in case the table is showing old data.</b>
