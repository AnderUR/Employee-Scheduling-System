    <br><br><h3><b>Submit Announcements</b></h3>
	Supervisors can add announcements that all ESS users can see using this form. Employees who are affected by this announcement will receive an email automatically when the announcement is set to show, based on the Show On date.

    <br><br><h3><b>Show On & Stop Showing On</b></h3>
	When creating a new announcement, use these fields' date pickers to set a date when the announcement will be visible to ESS users and when it will be removed from view.

    <br><br><h3><b>Types Of Submitted Announcements</b></h3>
  Announcements submitted using the <b>Submit Announcements Form</b> can be edited and removed (the user will see the edit and remove buttons). <br><br>
  When an exception is added from the <b>Edit Semester Form</b> in the Admin Panel > Semester tab, an automatic announcement is created.
  There is no edit or remove button for it. <br>
  To remove or edit an automatic announcement, click on the "View announcement" link under the exception that corresponds to this announcement.
