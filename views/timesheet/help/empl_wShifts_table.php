    <br><br><h3><b>Worked Shifts Table</b></h3>
	This table shows all worked shifts for the employee currently viewed. The data in this table is directly related to the week being viewed, as specified by the two date fields above this table. 
	    
    <br><br><h3><b>Shifts Column</b></h3>
    If the employee has a sign in/out time(s),The edit link in this column opens the <b>Edit Timesheet</b> form, to edit the worked shift. Otherwise, it will open the <b>Set In Timesheet</b> form to set the sign in/out time(s) to a custom time, or to the scheduled times. By default, the times shown in the <b>Set In Timesheet</b> form are the scheduled times as seen in the Schedule Table for the shift.

    <br><br><h3><b>Time In-Out Column</b></h3>
    This column displays the times the employee signed in and signed out. What is important to note is that these times are rounded to the nearest 7.dec according to the requirements of Human Resources.

    <br><br><h3><b>Stamps Columns</b></h3>
    When the employees sign in/out, they have to write their signature. These stamps columns show their in and out signature. 
    If instead of a signature a not found icon is displayed, even though the employee signed in and out successfully, then this means that this shift was marked as worked by a supervisor. If the employee signed in, but has not signed out, a not found icon will be shown in the Out-Stamp column.
    
    <br><br><h3><b>Approved Column</b></h3>
    A checkmark in this column means the shift has been approved and will count towards the total hours worked. Otherwise an X will be shown and the shift will not count. The need for approving a shift arises from an employee signing in to a shift they were not scheduled for by using the <b>Temporary Shift</b> form in the sign in page.
