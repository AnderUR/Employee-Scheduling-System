    <br><br><h3><b>Edit Semester</b></h3>
    The given semester can be edited by making changes to the various inputs and clicking the edit button.
    Changes to this form will be reflected in the <b>Semesters Table</b> in the Admin Panel > Semester tab

    <br><br><h3><b>Date Exceptions</b></h3>
    Exceptions refer to dates when there is no work or there is a swap of two dates because it is, for example, a Monday schedule.

    <br><br><h3><b>Add a No Work Exception</b></h3>
    To add a date when there is no work, fill Exception Date input with the date and select the No Replace checkbox. Then click Add.

    <br><br><h3><b>Add a Swap Date Exception</b></h3>
    If a day is being replaced by another (which we are calling swap date exception), fill the Exception date input with the date of when the change is happening.
    Next select the date which will be used instead, the date to swap with, from the Replace With input. Then click the add button.
    Example: 4/11/2018 is a Wednesday that follows a Friday schedule, select 4/11/2018 for the Exception date input, then select the Friday that has no classes for the Replace With input.
    The Replace With date is usually a future date, so it could be 4/13/2018. However, in this case, it is 4/06/2018 (Spring Recess Friday). <b>Please make sure that the Replace With date selected is a date where no one will sign in.</b> 

    <br>
    <b> Each time an exception is added, an automatic announcement is added for it explaining whether it is a no work exception, or a swap date exception.</b>

    <br><br><h3><b>Remove Exception </b></h3>
    Exceptions cannot be edited. If the user made a mistake adding an exception, the exception must be removed using the Remove button, then added once more.
    Removing an exception will also remove the automatic announcement.

    <br><br><h3><b>Edit/View Exception Announcement </b></h3>
    To edit the automatic exception posted when an exception is added, click the View announcement link, which will open a pop up with the corresponding exception.
