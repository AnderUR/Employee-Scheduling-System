    <br><br><h3><b>Add Worked Shift</b></h3>
    Use this form to schedule shifts and immediately mark them as worked for the given employee. To enter data, use the date pickers and time pickers that will show when clicking each field, since typing in these fields is disabled.<br><br> 
	Due to the <b>Set in Timesheet</b> form, <b>Temporary Shifts</b> and <b>Edit Timesheet</b> form, the <b>Add Worked Shift</b> form has one special purpose: 
	If a supervisor forgets to create a shift for an employee and the employee does not create a temporary shift because they forgot to sign in, then this form will allow the supervisor to <b>enter a worked shift that was not scheduled</b>.
