    <br><br><h3><b>Add Shift</b></h3>
    Use this form to enter shifts for the given employee using the date pickers and time pickers that will show when clicking each field, since typing in these fields is disabled. 
    
    <br><br><h3><b>Repeat weekly until...</b></h3>
    If the check-box is <b>unchecked</b>, the shift entered will be applied <b>once</b> for the selected date.<br>
    On the other hand, if the check-box is <b>checked</b>, the shift will be repeated weekly until the date entered in the input below it. It will be repeated by day of week, according to the due day. <br>
    Example: Entering a shift 8/8/17 (a Tuesday) and checking the box to repeat it weekly until 8/15/17 will repeat the shift every Tuesday until 8/15/17.
